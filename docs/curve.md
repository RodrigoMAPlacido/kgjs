title: Curves

Curves can be generated in two ways: by a univariate function or by a parametric function. 

First, let's look at a how a univariate function is generated: 

<div filename="curve/simple_curve" width="800" height="710" class="codePreview"></div>

Notice that the curve is a line, which we've been able to generate using points, slopes, and intercepts. Here is a comparison of the two methods: 

<div filename="curve/curves_vs_lines" width="800" height="710" class="codePreview"></div>

Here is a more complicated univariate function, the quadratic function: 

<div filename="curve/quadratic_curve" width="800" height="710" class="codePreview"></div>
