title: Three-Dimensional Graphs
---

Three-dimensional graphs are handled by a completely different set of code, called Mathbox; you can see its development [here](https://github.com/unconed/mathbox). Mathboxes have their own [layouts](layouts) and objects which are distinct from their 2D counterparts.
