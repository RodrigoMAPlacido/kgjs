<p>One of the primary reasons I created KGJS was to have ability to present multiple linked graphs. (This is a critical element of economic analysis, for example when you want to see how a change in one market affects other markets.) Layouts are pre-set combinations of graphs in different configurations.</p>

<p>The simplest layout is the OneGraph layout, which is what is used for most of the examples in this documentation. It takes a single <code class="highlighter-rouge">graph</code> child, which has the definition of the one graph in it. This has an aspect ratio of 1:1, meaning itâ€™s a square:</p>

<div width="500" height="450" class="codePreview">

layout:
  OneGraph:
    graph: 
      xAxis:
        title: X Axis
      yAxis:
        title: Y Axis
   
      
</div>

<p>Because you sometimes donâ€™t need to use all the vertical space afforded by a square graph, thereâ€™s also a OneWideGraph layout which has a 2:1 aspect ratio. If you want to have the graph appear to have the same dimensions on both axes, itâ€™s a good idea to double the number of ticks on the horizontal axis and make the scale twice as long:</p>

<div width="500" height="240" class="codePreview">

layout:
  OneWideGraph:
    graph: 
      xAxis:
        title: X Axis
        ticks: 10
      yAxis:
        title: Y Axis
        max: 5
      
</div>

<p>The TwoVerticalGraphs layout also has an aspect ratio of 1:1, but each of the graphs in it (defined by the children <code class="highlighter-rouge">topGraph</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">bottomGraph</code>) has an aspect ratio of 2:1:</p>

<div width="500" height="440" class="codePreview">

layout:
  TwoVerticalGraphs:
    topGraph:
      xAxis:
        title: Top X Axis
      yAxis:
        title: Top Y Axis
    bottomGraph:
      xAxis:
        title: Bottom X Axis
      yAxis:
        title: Bottom Y Axis
      
</div>

<p>A lot of the time when you use this layout, the horizontal axes have the same value, so we donâ€™t label the top graphâ€™s x-axis. Another trick is to take advantage of the knowledge that the graph will be a rectangle, and adjust the axis values so that the tick marks represent the same values:</p>

<div width="500" height="440" class="codePreview">

layout:
  TwoVerticalGraphs:
    topGraph:
      xAxis:
        ticks: 10
      yAxis:
        max: 5
        title: Top Y Axis
    bottomGraph:
      xAxis:
        ticks: 10
        title: X Axis
      yAxis:
        max: 5
        title: Bottom Y Axis
      
</div>

<p>The TwoHorizontalGraphs layout is has an aspect ratio of 2:1, and places two square graphs (defined by <code class="highlighter-rouge">leftGraph</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">rightGraph</code>) side-by-side:</p>

<div width="500" height="250" class="codePreview">

layout:
  TwoHorizontalGraphs:
    leftGraph:
      xAxis: {title: Left X Axis}
      yAxis: {title: Left Y Axis}
    rightGraph:
      xAxis: {title: Right X Axis}
      yAxis: {title: Right Y Axis}
      
</div>

<p>There are also layouts for larger numbers of graphs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ThreeHorizontalGraphs takes children <code class="highlighter-rouge">leftGraph</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">middleGraph</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">rightGraph</code>. Hereâ€™s an <a href="https://www.econgraphs.org/graphs/micro/equilibrium/partial_equilibrium/summing_two_individuals_linear_demands">example</a>.</li>
  <li>SquarePlusTwoVerticalGraphs takes children <code class="highlighter-rouge">bigGraph</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">topGraph</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">bottomGraph</code>. Hereâ€™s an <a href="https://www.econgraphs.org/graphs/micro/equilibrium/general_equilibrium/ppf_and_production_functions">example</a>.</li>
  <li>FourGraphs takes children <code class="highlighter-rouge">topLeftGraph</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">topRightGraph</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">bottomLeftGraph</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">bottomRightGraph</code>. Iâ€™ve never actually used this one! :)
These all do basically what you would imagine.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some additional specialty layouts for economics, which handle things like game matrices and Edgeworth Boxes.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s also possible to create a custom layout by positioning a graph exactly where you want to; if youâ€™re interested in finding out more, or requesting additional layouts be constructed, drop me a line.</p>
